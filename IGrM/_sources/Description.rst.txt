How to Use
================================

Most useful halo information is stored in the `prop` 
attribute of the `class halo_props`. And to modify what 
to be calculated, one will need to provide a new field 
dictionary similarly organized as the default field 
dictionary. Note that quantities related to temperature 
and luminosity are mostly hard coded, so you may need to 
modify the source code to meet your own requirements.

Generally there are four types of properties stored in 
the `prop` attribute: R (radius), M (mass), T (temperature) 
and S (entropy). And the following list explains the physical 
meaning of the terms in the default field dictionary.
