title: Is the Large-scale Structure Traced by the BOSS LOWZ Galaxies Consistent with Planck?
category: observational-cosmology
summary: We introduce cluster–galaxy cross-correlation into 2x2pt analysis and find the combination of them prefer Planck over low $S_8$ cosmology.

figureCaption: Comparison between galaxy biases measured from the cluster-based method (green vertical band), galaxy clustering (blue circles), and g–g lensing (red squares), under four different cosmologies, including <i>Planck</i> ($A=1.0$), two low-$\sigma_8$ cosmologies with $A= 0.9$ and $0.8$, and a representative low-$S_8$ cosmology that resolves the clustering–lensing mismatch.

## Highlights

- We find the BOSS LOWZ galaxies have spurious correlations on large-scales, implying potential systematics during the target selection and that the galaxy bias $b_g$ measured from clustering may be questionable;
- We develop a method to independently measure $b_g$ from cluster–galaxy cross-correlation, which helps to break the degeneracy between $b_g$ and $\sigma_8$ in $2\times2{\rm pt}$ analysis;
- After including the independent bias measured from cluster–galaxy cross-correlation, we find the combination of the data vector still prefers a <i>Planck</i> cosmology — despite the $b_g$ measured from clustering and lensing would agree better under a low-$\sigma_8$ cosmology, both of them will be in strong tension with the bias measured from cluster–galaxy cross-correlation.
