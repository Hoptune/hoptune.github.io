I'm a fifth-year PhD student working with [<u>Prof. Ying Zu</u>](https://tdli.sjtu.edu.cn/en/people/40984/ying-zu) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. During my PhD, I leverage the [<u>Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)</u>](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/) to study galaxy–halo connection and cosmology, using multiple probes from dwarf galaxies to massive clusters.
